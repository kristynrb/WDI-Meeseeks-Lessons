# RESPONSIVE DESIGN

![responsive](https://d2xdl4ekgh4j79.cloudfront.net/courses/learn-build-design-make-responsive-website-dreamweaver-cs6/l3.png)


The starter code for tonight is a design mockup for a **mobile first** app. 
Open up `index.html` in your browser and take a look-see.

### Directions

Rewrite / edit the `style.css` file to make this mockup responsive. When the user's window is expanded, the site contents should widen, re-arrange, and adjust to the dimensions of the browser window.

Make it so that the expanded mockup looks like the layout in the `Mockup.jpg` image. `Mockup.jpg` is a rough estimation of how the layout should look on a desktop app. When the window is sufficiently narrowed, the site should go back to the mobile layout.

### Tools

There are a number of ways to go about doing this. For example, you might want to use `min-width`, `max-width`, `min-height`, `max-height`, media queries, percentages, and you might want to dynamically change display properties to `float` or dynamically change list elements from `inline-block` to `block` -- it's up to you to get the site you want.

### Tips

Don't get hung up on the navbar. If it's not working, save it for later.
